# Moodle GovBR-DS Theme
Government Digital Identity for Moodle

These instructions describe how to correctly install the "moodle-govbrds" plugin.

We have the support of the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Roraima - IFRR, through the following sectors:

- Technology and Support Coordination - CTS / DIPEAD / IFRR

- Information Technology Directorate - DTI / IFRR

This version of the plugin was developed within the scope of IFRR with funding from Fundape.

It is currently supported by Fábio Santos, Fundape scholarship holder and IFRR employee.
